``git-ibisect``: interactively run git bisect (with undo!)
==========================================================

**ALPHA WARNING**: this project is still *very alpha*!

``git-ibisect`` is an interactive wrapper around ``git bisect`` which makes it
easy to run bisect from any directory (not just the repository root), run a
series of commands before each step, and undo mistakes made while bisecting:

<pre><code>$ <strong>git ibisect</strong>
guess which commit is first good commit (hash, branch, or a number of commits back): <strong>5</strong>
git bisect start
git bisect bad
git checkout HEAD~5
&gt; Note: checking out 'HEAD~5'.
&gt;
&gt; You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
&gt; changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
&gt; state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.
&gt;
&gt; If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
&gt; do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:
&gt;
&gt;   git checkout -b &lt;new-branch-name&gt;
&gt;
&gt; HEAD is now at 40bafc4 Initial

hint: test this commit to see if it is good or bad:
 ibisect&gt; run make clean && make && make test

ibisect (no good)&gt; <strong>run exit 0</strong> <em>(simulate a passing test)</em>
'exit 0' exited with status 0
mark this commit as good [Y/n]: <strong>y</strong>
git bisect good
&gt; Bisecting: 2 revisions left to test after this (roughly 1 step)
&gt; [d2934c797d4412319e04f12944899eff6fb9975a] Add license, installation
re-run 'exit 0' [Y/n]: <strong>y</strong>

'exit 0' exited with status 0
mark this commit as good [Y/n]: <strong>y</strong>
git bisect good
&gt; Bisecting: 0 revisions left to test after this (roughly 1 step)
&gt; [65acd6c743160df3188a030ae0445c38d453baf7] Add status command
re-run 'exit 0' [Y/n]: <strong>n</strong>
ibisect (~1 commits)&gt;
ibisect (~1 commits)&gt; <strong>run exit 1</strong> <em>(simulate a failing test)</em>
'exit 1' exited with status 256
mark this commit as bad [Y/n]: <strong>y</strong>
git bisect bad
&gt; Bisecting: 0 revisions left to test after this (roughly 0 steps)

Installation
============

Manually:

    $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wolever/git-ibisect/master/git-ibisect -O /usr/local/bin/git-ibisect
    $ chmod +x /usr/local/bin/git-ibisect

TODO
====

- Documentation:
  - Introduction which describes what bisect is and how it works
  - Better walkthrough of using ibisct
- Handle bisecting when starting from a dirty state (ex, prompt to `git stash`?)
- Figure out how to write tests
- Tab completion of filenames when using `run` and `autorun`
- Make sure ^C is handled well:
  - When running tests: should prompt "was this commit/bad/ignore?"
  - When prompting for input: should return to command line
- Add option to skip commit
- Allow bisect options to be passed from the command line:
  - `git ibisect reset`
  - `git ibisect undo`
  - etc
